This project tries to show a systemtap usage scenario a bit different from
usual: monitoring a system status to identify possible break-in attempts,
either detecting incoming portscans and via anomaly analysis.

A tapset for detecting incoming portscans is available in the tapsets/
directory; for an example of its usage see showscan.stp.

Another script, collect_data.stp, allows to group events into different
categories and can be used to gather data to be eventually analyzed.

Be sure to add tapsets/ to the tapset search directory, for example with the -I
option:

$ stap -v -I tapsets/ showscan.stp
